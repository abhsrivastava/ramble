# Ramble is an application which helps people in washington state find a hike

The biggest impediment for hiking in washington state is the weather. We have to really search for a place where its not raining so that we can find hikes in that area.

Ramble does the following (1) maintains a database of all zip codes of washington state where there are trails (2) queries the weather api to find forecast of places where its "not raining/snowing/windy" and recommends hikes in those zip codes.

The objective is to save time and quickly find a place to hike!

Ramble uses Free open-source API [open-meteo](https://open-meteo.com) as the data source.
